## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### ✅ Issue #210: Add CODEOWNERS File
**What was done:**
- Created `.github/CODEOWNERS` covering all `src/` paths
- Tighter ownership for `src/indexer/`, `src/auth.ts`, and `src/db/migrations/`
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to document review expectations

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- ✅ Every path under `src/` has an owner
- ✅ Migrations and auth require an owner's review  
- ✅ The expectation is documented

**Action required:** Maintainers must replace `@PLACEHOLDER_OWNER` with actual GitHub usernames and enable branch protection rules.

---

### ✅ Issue #214: Document Log Field Schema
**What was done:**
- Created comprehensive `docs/LOGGING.md` covering:
  - Complete field schema (standard, request-scoped, application-specific)
  - Fields containing identifying data with retention guidance
  - Stable alertable event patterns
  - Example queries for common operational tasks
  - Note on subsystems not yet using Pino (issue #132)

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- ✅ The log schema is documented with field-level detail
- ✅ Fields carrying identifying data are called out with retention guidance
- ✅ Alertable event names are listed

---

### ✅ Issue #215: Generate Machine-Readable API Description
**What was done:**
- Confirmed issue #8 did not deliver an OpenAPI spec (no artifacts found)
- Generated `openapi.json` (OpenAPI 3.0.3, 351 lines) from Fastify routes
- Added npm scripts: `openapi:generate` and `openapi:validate`
- Integrated `@fastify/swagger` and `@fastify/swagger-ui`
- Interactive API docs available at `/docs` endpoint
- CI fails when spec drifts from routes
- Replaced README's hand-written API table with spec reference
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to require spec regeneration when changing routes

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- ✅ A machine-readable API description is produced by the build
- ✅ CI fails when it drifts from the routes
- ✅ Downstream consumers have an artifact to generate from
- ✅ `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` all pass

**Frontend note:** `openapi.json` can be used to generate type-safe client code for `ourdao-frontend`.

---

### ✅ Issue #216: Document Migration Numbering Rule
**What was done:**
- Added "Schema changes" subsection to CONTRIBUTING.md covering:
  - Unique, sequential version numbering
  - File naming pattern: `<version>_<description>.sql`
  - Requirement to update `schema.sql` in same PR (with explanation)
  - Fresh-database shortcut behavior
  - Manual verification requirement

**Acceptance criteria met:**
- ✅ A contributor can add a migration correctly from CONTRIBUTING alone
- ✅ The uniqueness and sequencing rules are explicit
- ✅ The `schema.sql` mirroring requirement is stated with its reason

---

## 🚀 How to Verify

1. **CODEOWNERS:** Check `.github/CODEOWNERS` exists
2. **Logging docs:** Read `docs/LOGGING.md`
3. **OpenAPI spec:**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Visit http://localhost:4000/docs
   - Run `npm run openapi:validate` (should pass)
4. **Migration docs:** Read CONTRIBUTING.md "Schema changes" section
5. **All checks:** Run `npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run build`

---

## ⚡ Breaking Changes

**None.** All changes are additive (documentation, tooling, CI checks).

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Maintainers:** Replace `@PLACEHOLDER_OWNER` in CODEOWNERS with actual usernames
2. **Branch Protection:** Enable "Require review from Code Owners"
3. **Logging:** Consider setting up alerts based on `docs/LOGGING.md` patterns
4. **Frontend:** Share `openapi.json` for potential type generation
